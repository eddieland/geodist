# pygeodist

Python bindings for `geodist`. The Python package currently only exposes the
`EARTH_RADIUS_METERS` constant from the Rust core while the geodesic kernels are
built out; new bindings will be added as the Rust surface stabilizes.

- For installation and development setup, see the project-level docs in `../README.md`.
- Publishing details (PyPI trusted publishing via GitHub Actions) also live in
  `../README.md#publishing`.
